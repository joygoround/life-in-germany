## Withdrawing cash from supermarkets (Geld Abheben)ℹ️

Germany is still to some degree driven by cash, and there are some places that you still can only pay by cash. So it's sometimes a pain to have that cash always with you, unless you have a bank nearby to you where you can withdraw. 

But there's a nice option that you can withdraw from a supermarkets if you buy more than 20 Euro (Citation needed) worth of product. I don't know if this applies for all types of banks, but you can check when you open a bank. I'm using debit cards from Deutschebank, and I had withdrew from REWE, Edeka and many other supermarkets. You just have to say "Ich hatte gerne XX Euro Abheben" when you're paying. There's a 200 Euro limit per transaction.
